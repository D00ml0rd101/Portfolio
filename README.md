# Portfolio
A collection of example code, mostly in python, showcasing my ability to solve mathematical problems with programming.
Anything of the form euler_xxx is problem number xxx from projecteuler.net, a public list of interesting mathematicl problems. The first 100 are intended to be easy with example solutions available, with any problems past that being significantly harder with no sharing of solutions allowed.<br/>
Some good example files to look at would be:<br/>
Python: euler_235<br/>
C#: Program.cs - code only for my honours thesis. The working project can be provided on request<br/>
R: Rolling_stats & Rolling_stats_analysis
